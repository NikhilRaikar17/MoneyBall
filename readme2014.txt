Project MoneyBall : 
   
GOAL    : Evaluation of baseball statistics.

Purpose : The purpose of the project is to make better decisions about the commitment
          of players with the help of data mining methods and techniques of baseball
          stats.
Tools Used : SAP UI5 Application that evaluates baseball statistics using data mining
             techniques and methods.

Project supervisor : Stephan Willhart.

1.1 Introduction

This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for
Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2014.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to
make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What
started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a
team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the
largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available
anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key
contributors to this project.)

Much of the raw data contained in this database comes from the work of
Pete Palmer, the legendary statistician, who has had a hand in most 
of the baseball encylopedias published since 1974. He is largely 
responsible for bringing the batting, pitching, and fielding data out
of the dark ages and into the computer era.  Without him, none of this
would be possible.  For more on Pete's work, please read his own 
account at: http://sabr.org/cmsfiles/PalmerDatabaseHistory.pdf

Three people have been key contributors to the work that followed, first 
by taking the raw data and creating a relational database, and later 
by extending the database to make it more accesible to researchers.

Sean Lahman launched the Baseball Archive's website back before 
most people had heard of the world wide web.  Frustrated by the
lack of sports data available, he led the effort to build a 
baseball database that everyone could use. Baseball researchers 
everywhere owe him a debt of gratitude.  Lahman served as an associate
editor for three editions of Total Baseball and contributed to five
editions of The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia. He has also been active in
developing databases for other sports.

The work of Sean Forman to create and maintain an online encyclopedia
at "baseball-reference.com" has been remarkable. Recognized as the 
premier online reference source, Forman's site provides an oustanding
interface to the raw data. His efforts to help streamline the database
have been extremely helpful. Most importantly, Forman has spearheaded
the effort to provide standards that enable several different baseball
databases to be used together. He was also instrumental in launching
the Baseball Databank, a forum for researchers to gather and share
their work.

Since 2001, these two Seans have led a group of researchers
who volunteered to maintain and update the database. 

Ted Turocy has done the lion's share of the work to updating the main
data tables since 2012, including significant imporvements to the
demographic data in the master table. In his role as SABR data czar,
he led the effort to document college playing stints for all
major league players. Turocy also spearheads the Chadwick Baseball
Bureau. For more details on his tools and services, visit:
http://chadwick.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html  

A handful of researchers have made substantial contributions to 
maintain this database over years. Listed alphabetically, they 
are: Derek Adair, Mike Crain, Kevin Johnson, Rod Nelson, Tom Tango,
and Paul Wendt. These folks did much of the heavy lifting, and are 
largely responsible for the improvements made since 2000.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 Data Tables

The design follows these general principles.  Each player is assigned a
unique number (playerID).  All of the information relating to that player
is tagged with his playerID.  The playerIDs are linked to names and 
birthdates in the MASTER table.

The database is comprised of the following main tables:

  MASTER - Player names, DOB, and biographical info
  Batting - batting statistics
  Pitching - pitching statistics
  Fielding - fielding statistics

It is supplemented by these tables:

  AllStarFull - All-Star appearances
  HallofFame - Hall of Fame voting data
  Managers - managerial statistics
  Teams - yearly stats and standings 
  BattingPost - post-season batting statistics
  PitchingPost - post-season pitching statistics
  FieldingPost- post-season field information data
  Salaries - player salary data
  SeriesPost - post-season series information
  AwardsManagers - awards won by managers 
  AwardsPlayers - awards won by players
  AwardsShareManagers - award voting for manager awards
  AwardsSharePlayers - award voting for player awards
  Appearances - details on the positions a player appeared at
  CollegePlaying - list of players and the colleges they attended


Sections 2.1 through 2.24 of this document describe each of the tables in
detail and the fields that each contains.
